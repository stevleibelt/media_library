# Media Library

This project wants to provide a rest based application to manage your media library. With version 1, it will have support for audio, book, game and video.

It is written in javascript, html and php. The frontend will be an ajax based single side page. A possible mobile app is planned but in the far far away future.

    * use php/propel objects for writing (by supporting Commands)
        * writing is working with events to keep update in sql database fast
        * event handler is taking care of updating reading part
    * use redis/coucheDb for reading (by supporting queries)
        * data of reading can differ from needed output
            * simple json/xml for general questions
